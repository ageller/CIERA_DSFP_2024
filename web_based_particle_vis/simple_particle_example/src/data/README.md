This dataset include supernovae up to 2019. I originally downloaded the data from The Open Supernova Catalog (which I think is now defunct?) on Aug. 20, 2019, and then processed it myself for use in this WebGL visualization. See [here](https://github.com/ageller/IDEAS_FSS-Vis/blob/main/WebGL/threejs/SNdata/src/data/convertOpenSN.ipynb) for more information on the data contents and my manipulation. In the WebGL vis, the SNe are plotted in galactocentric cartesian coordinates.
