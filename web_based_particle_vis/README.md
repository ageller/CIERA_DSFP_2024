# Web-based Interactive Particle Visualization

In this workshop, we will cover the basics of visualization particle data on the web using WebGL and the three.js library.  We will also explore the [Firefly](https://firefly.rcs.northwestern.edu/) visualization tool and learn how to use Firefly to visualize, interrogate and make selections on your data.  This workshop assumes a familiarity with Python.  We will also discuss Javascript code, though participants do not need to be familiar with Javascript beforehand.

## Exercise

1. Download/generate/use your own data that has x,y,z and other attributes.
	- *Suggestion:* Gaia data (e.g., for a galactic open cluster)
2. Ingest this into Firefly and explore it in a Jupyter notebook.
	- Make sure to include attributes to color/filter by.
4. Use the (new) data selection tool to select a portion of your data using Firefly.
5. Create a plot of these selected data using Python.
6. Share the result with us!
